# SoundManager

SoundManager is an application designed to manage and organise sound effect libraries. The aim of the application is to increase the workflow of sound designers and other disciples working with large quantities of audio files, by enabling them to find all of their sound files in one place with tools to keep them organised.

Please note that in order to build the application you will need to have [Juce](https://juce.com/) installed. However, if you have Juce, simply build the application using the source code and you are good to go. You can get started by importing audio files into SoundManager via drag and drop. You can find a Features option in the help menu which will open a window explaining the most important features of SoundManager.

You can find the documentation for the classes I used in this project [Here](https://anttiliakka-portfolio.com/SoundManager/annotated.html).
